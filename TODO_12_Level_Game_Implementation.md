  - Verify `GetNextLevelId()` works correctly for level 12
  - Test level progression from 1-12
  - ✅ Updated with debug logging and default values for new fields

- [x] **1.3** Test checkpoint system with 12 levels
  - Verify checkpoint at level 6 works
  - Test restart from checkpoint functionality
  - ✅ Added debug methods to test checkpoint and level progression
  - ✅ Checkpoint system ready for 12-level game

## Phase 2: Audio System
- [x] **2.1** Update `AudioManager.cs` for level-specific music
  - Add music switching based on `backgroundMusic` field
  - Implement: `tutorial_theme`, `action_theme`, `challenge_theme`, `boss_theme`
  - ✅ Added level-specific music tracks
  - ✅ Added OnLevelLoaded event subscription
  - ✅ Added GetLevelMusic method for theme mapping
  - ✅ Added debug method for testing

- [x] **2.2** Test audio integration
  - Verify music changes correctly between levels
  - Test audio persistence across checkpoint restarts
  - ✅ Added comprehensive audio integration test
  - ✅ Added level loading test to verify OnLevelLoaded events
  - ✅ Added volume settings and persistence testing

## Phase 3: Special Mechanics System
- [ ] **3.1** Implement duck movement system
  - Update `BaseDuck.cs` with movement capabilities
  - Add `moveSpeed` parameter usage
  - Test basic movement

- [ ] **3.2** Implement special mechanics
  - Add `slow_movement` mechanic
  - Add `fast_movement` mechanic
  - Add `overlapping_spawns` mechanic
  - Test each mechanic individually

- [ ] **3.3** Update `DuckSpawner.cs` for mechanics
  - Add mechanics parsing and application
  - Test spawner with different mechanics

## Phase 4: UI and Feedback Systems
- [ ] **4.1** Add difficulty display
  - Show current level difficulty in UI
  - Test difficulty display across all levels

- [ ] **4.2** Add success rate tracking
  - Implement success rate calculation in `GameManager.cs`
  - Display current vs target success rate
  - Test success rate accuracy

- [ ] **4.3** Add level information display
  - Show `designNotes` and `learningObjective`
  - Test information display

## Phase 5: Game Balance and Testing
- [ ] **5.1** Test complete level progression
  - Play through all 12 levels
  - Verify checkpoint system works
  - Test game completion after level 12

- [ ] **5.2** Test difficulty curve
  - Verify progression from tutorial to expert
  - Test checkpoint restart balance
  - Verify scoring system works across all levels

- [ ] **5.3** Performance testing
  - Test with all mechanics active
  - Verify no memory leaks
  - Test audio performance

## Phase 6: Polish and Optimization
- [ ] **6.1** Add visual feedback for mechanics
  - Visual indicators for moving ducks
  - Difficulty-based UI changes
  - Success rate visual feedback

- [ ] **6.2** Add achievement system
  - Track when players meet target success rates
  - Add achievement notifications
  - Test achievement system

- [ ] **6.3** Final testing and bug fixes
  - Comprehensive playthrough testing
  - Fix any discovered issues
  - Performance optimization

## Notes
- Checkpoint is set at level 6 (halfway through 12 levels)
- Game completion triggers after level 12
- Special mechanics include: slow_movement, fast_movement, overlapping_spawns, power_up_recommended
- Music themes: tutorial_theme, action_theme, challenge_theme, boss_theme
- Difficulty levels: tutorial, easy, medium, expert
